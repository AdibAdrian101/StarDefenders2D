# StarDefenders2D
This is a source code of my Star Defenders 2D game which you can usually play here: https://www.gevanni.com:3000

Finish it (contact me on twitter or patreon for that, I have plenty of plans, features and suggestions for bug fixes) or suggest updates as pull requests if you want to. 

Reason for that is, as usually - I must go, my planet needs me. But once I'm done after working on my primary project I may revisit this one. But do you really want to wait?
